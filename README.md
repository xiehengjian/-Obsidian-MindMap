# Mind Map Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin allows you to create a mind map in Obsidian using the native canvas feature. It automatically adjusts the card layout according to the structure of the mind map.

# Closed-Source Disclaimer
I created this plugin for my personal use and decided to make it available to others who may find it useful. However, I currently have no compelling reason to make the source code available and have chosen to keep it closed. 

## Features

- Fully based on Obsidian's native canvas, which means you can use all canvas features such as inserting web pages, Markdown support, and linking files on your mind map.
- Automatically adjusts the card layout when creating nodes.
- Provides buttons and keyboard shortcuts to create sibling and child nodes.

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian and go to Settings -> Third-party plugins.
2. Search for "BRAT" and click "Install".
3. Use BRAT to install xiehengjian/Obsidian-Mindmap

## Usage

To use this plugin, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a new canvas file in Obsidian.
2. Create the first card in the canvas.
3. Click on the card to activate the mind map mode.
4. You will see two new buttons: "Create Child Node" and "Create Sibling Node".
5. Use these buttons to create new nodes and expand your mind map.
6. The mind map will automatically adjust the layout to keep it neat and organized.
